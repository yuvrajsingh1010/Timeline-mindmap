        The Product Requirements Document (PRD) serves as a comprehensive guide 
        outlining the functional and non-functional requirements of the new vehicle. 
        This document details features, functionalities, performance criteria, and quality 
        standards, ensuring a common understanding among stakeholders. By documenting 
        requirements in detail, the manufacturer mitigates scope creep, facilitates effective 
        project management, and aligns development efforts with customer needs and expectations.
