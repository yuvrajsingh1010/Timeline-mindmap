        The manufacturing phase transforms design specifications and prototypes 
        into mass-produced vehicles using efficient and cost-effective production 
        methods. It involves sourcing raw materials, tooling, fabrication, assembly, 
        quality control, and supply chain management. These activities are orchestrated 
        to ensure timely delivery of high-quality products within budget constraints. 
        By optimizing processes and managing resources effectively, manufacturers 
        streamline production while maintaining product integrity. The manufacturing 
        phase is critical for scaling up production and meeting market demand while 
        upholding quality standards.</p>
