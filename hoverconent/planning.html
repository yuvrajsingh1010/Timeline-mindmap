        The Planning phase sets clear objectives, requirements, and timelines 
        for the new vehicle project. This involves strategic decision-making processes 
        to guide the project from conception to execution, ensuring alignment with 
        organizational goals and stakeholder expectations. Comprehensive documentation 
        in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and specifications lays the foundation 
        for data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement initiatives throughout 
        the project lifecycle.
