        The manufacturing phase transforms design specifications into mass-produced 
        vehicles through efficient and cost-effective production processes. Activities 
        such as sourcing raw materials, fabrication, assembly, and quality control are 
        orchestrated to deliver high-quality products on time and within budget.
