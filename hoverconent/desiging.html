        Design processes transform conceptual ideas and requirements into 
        tangible designs and prototypes for the new vehicle. Hardware design 
        focuses on developing physical components and systems, while software 
        design crafts embedded systems, control algorithms, and user interfaces. 
        Iterative processes of ideation, conceptualization, prototyping, and 
        validation ensure innovative, user-centric solutions that meet performance 
        standards and regulatory requirements.
