        In the hardware design phase, mechanical, electrical, and automotive 
        engineering disciplines are integrated to develop physical components 
        and systems for the new vehicle. This process aims to optimize performance, 
        efficiency, and durability while meeting design requirements and regulatory 
        standards.
